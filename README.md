# Artificial Intelligence 

I am a software developer with an analytical and scientific mindset, who graduated in Communications. I am particularly interested in mobile software development and artificial intelligence.

I am a graduate in Social Communication from FAM and I completed my MBA in Mobile App Development at FIAP.

With over 9 years of experience in projects involving Android, iOS and Web, I master technologies such as React Native, Ionic, Next.js, SwiftUI and Python to deliver a differentiated user experience. My extensive experience in software development enables me to create effective user interfaces, applying methods, techniques and mathematical models to optimize the development process, as well as solving challenges related to UI creation, performance and loading time.

In the payments segment, I worked on a project whose objective was to improve user ratings on the Android and iOS stores and help retain users when using the app. To do this, I implemented improvements to the user interface, the payment experience and security.

The results were positive: in six months, there was a 10% increase in positive ratings in the stores, a 20% increase in the user retention rate and a 5% increase in the use of the app in challenging contexts.

I have a specialized perspective in the area of Mobile App Development Engineering, while maintaining a generalist vision with comprehensive knowledge, focusing on generating value for the client in all phases of the project. I have a real passion for building products that impact and transform the daily lives of users, providing convenience, security and respect.
